What are you doing right now?
  You are getting the matching to happen by using socket.io

Things to do:
 √ Implement the matching feature
  √ find an efficient system to wait for a newcomer (probably a queue)
  √ if the queue isn't empty, resolve immediately. Otherwise wait till a new user enters
 √ Send messages back and forth
  √ Get rid of blank messages
 - Have the messages read back scrollable
 √ Fix fonts
 - Fix username check regex to be more specific ('hello' not accepted because it has 'hell')

 - What do you do if there is a disconnect?
  √ If the socket doesn't reconnect before a timeout, send the kill message to the pairing socket
  * If it's the server, then send a reconnect message with the socket id you got
 - Have a cancel button for waiting to pair
 - Build a proper input box
  * Give it good functionality as to word suggestions. Further more, use machine learning to find good alternatives.
 - Improve UI/UX design (perpetual)
 - Use statistic to find the best interval time for the "check if someone else is there"
 - When a chatter is typing, have the '...' thing appear
